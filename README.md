# Heart Disease Detection ML

This project uses machine learning techniques to detect heart disease based on clinical data. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model training/evaluation.

## Project Structure

- `Machine_Learning.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing all code for data analysis, preprocessing, modeling, and visualization.
- `heart_diesease.csv`: Raw dataset used for training and analysis.
- `Heart_cleaned_data.csv`: Cleaned dataset after preprocessing.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install required Python packages:
    ```sh
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn imbalanced-learn
    ```
3. Open `Machine_Learning.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
4. Run the cells to reproduce the analysis and results.

## Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Handling imbalanced data with SMOTE
- Visualization of categorical and numerical features
- Model training with Random Forest, AdaBoost, KNN, and more
- Evaluation metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, confusion matrix

## Results

See the notebook for detailed results, visualizations, and model performance.
